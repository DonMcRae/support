<h1>Rules API Methods</h1>
<h2>C# Example</h2>
<p>The following Ruby snippets demonstrate how to perform the following rule-management operations on Gnip's Rules API.
<ul>
	<li>
		Add a rule to a stream</li>
	<li>
		Delete a rule from a stream</li>
	<li>
		Retrieve the list of rules for a stream</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Each snippet can be modified to perform these operations on:
<ul>
	<li>
		Premium Gnip streams, using JSON formatted rules</li>
	<li>
		Enterprise Data Collector streams, using JSON formatted rules</li>
	<li>
		Enterprise Data Collector streams, using XML formatted rules</li>
</ul>
Each snippet provides examples of what the stream URL should look like for each type described above, and includes specific lines that may be commented or uncommented depending on the type of stream you are using.</p>
